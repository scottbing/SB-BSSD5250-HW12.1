BlendMode

inline class BlendMode
Algorithms to use when painting on the canvas.

When drawing a shape or image onto a canvas, different algorithms can be used to blend the pixels. The different values of BlendMode specify different such algorithms.

Each algorithm has two inputs, the source, which is the image being drawn, and the destination, which is the image into which the source image is being composited. The destination is often thought of as the background. The source and destination both have four color channels, the red, green, blue, and alpha channels. These are typically represented as numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. The output of the algorithm also has these same four channels, with values computed from the source and destination.

The horizontal and vertical bars in these images show the red, green, and blue channels with varying opacity levels, then all three color channels together with those same varying opacity levels, then all three color channels set to zero with those varying opacity levels, then two bars showing a red/green/blue repeating gradient, the first with full opacity and the second with partial opacity, and finally a bar with the three color channels set to zero but the opacity varying in a repeating gradient.

Application to the Canvas API
When using Canvas.saveLayer and Canvas.restore, the blend mode of the Paint given to the Canvas.saveLayer will be applied when Canvas.restore is called. Each call to Canvas.saveLayer introduces a new layer onto which shapes and images are painted; when Canvas.restore is called, that layer is then composited onto the parent layer, with the source being the most-recently-drawn shapes and images, and the destination being the parent layer. (For the first Canvas.saveLayer call, the parent layer is the canvas itself.)
